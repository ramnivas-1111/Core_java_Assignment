Programming Question: Student Class with Grade Calculation

 Design a Java class named Student that encapsulates information about students, including name, ID, course, fee, grade, and average. Your class should include a constructor for creating a student object by copying another student object and a method to calculate the grade based on the average.

Take a  Student class  (BLC Class)

should have the following elements:

Attributes/properties/varriables :


Names			data type		
------------		---------------       
Name      			: String
ID            		: int
Course  			: String
Fee				: double
Grade			: char
Average			: double

Acess Modifier 	:private(for all Varriables) 

Constructors:

A parameterized constructor that initializes a student object with basic information, such as name, ID, course, and fee.

A parameterized constructor that initializes a student object by copying another student object.(copy constructor)


Method:

Method Name    : calculateGrade()
Access modifier : public
Return Type       : char 
 
that initialize the grade of a student based on the average. Use the following grading scale:

A: Average >= 90
B: Average >= 80
C: Average >= 70
D: Average >= 60
F: Average < 60


Tester Class:(ELC Class)

In the main method, demonstrate the usage of the Student class by creating instances with different constructors, setting average values, and calculating grades.


Test Case-1 :
---------------
 Valid Case:

 Average = 76

 Sample Input: average = 76

Expected Output: "Grade for average 76: C"


Test Case-2 :
---------------

Valid Case: Average = 58

Sample Input: average = 58

Expected Output: "Grade for average 58: F"

Test Case-3 :
----------------
Invalid Case: mark = -10

Input: mark = -10
Expected Output: "Error: Average mark must be between 0 and 100."
