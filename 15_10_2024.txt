Question-1
-------------
You've been assigned the task of developing a Java program to manage employee information and salary updates based on performance evaluations.

Employee Class:[BLC Class]
-------------------
Create an Employee class with the following 
Attributes:
--------------
Names			dataType
---------		-----------
name                    String
age                     int 
department              String
salary                  double 
performance 		String

Implement a constructor that takes parameters to initialize the attributes of the Employee object.

Provide getter and setter methods for each attribute to ensure proper encapsulation.

Update Salary Method:

Method:
-------------
MethodName  		:updateSalary()
Return Type		:double
Access Modifier 	:public

Implement a method named updateSalary within the Employee class. This method should update the salary based on the employee's performance evaluation.

notes:
If the performance is "good", add a bonus of ?10,000 to  the salary.
If the performance is "average", add a bonus of ?5,000 to the salary.
If the performance is null, no bonus is added.

Create a EmployeeTester class [ELC Class]
In the main method:
Create at least three Employee objects with different performance evaluations.
Call the updateSalary method for each employee.
Print the updated salaries of all employees.

Test Cases :
---------------
case-1
---------
Name: shaktiman
Age: 30
Department: Sales
Salary: 50000
Performance: good

Expected Output :
valid input (print all the above details)

case-2
--------
Sample Input :

Name: Gangadhar
Age: -25
Department: HR
Salary: 47000
Performance: good

Expected Output :
Invalid input. Age must be a positive integer.





Question -2   
---------------  
Design a inventory system for a retail store :
  
InventoryItem Class: [BLC Class]

Create an InventoryItem class with the following 
 
Attributes:
--------------
Names			dataType
---------		-----------
itemName        	String 
pricePerUnit    	double 
quantityInStock 	int 

Implement a constructor that takes parameters to initialize the attributes of the InventoryItem object.

Provide getter and setter methods for each attribute to ensure proper encapsulation.

 Method:
-------------
MethodName  		:calculateTotalValue()
Return Type		:double
Access Modifier 	:public

This method should calculate and return the total value of the inventory item in stock, which is the product of the price per unit and the quantity in stock.


Take a InventoryMain class (ELC Class) which is having  main method to  Create instances of the InventoryItem class, perform calculations, and display relevant information such as the total value of the item in stock and whether a reorder is required.

Taste Case -1
-----------------
Sample Input :

Item Name: "Apples"
Price per Unit: 10
Quantity in Stock: 15

Expected Output: 
Total Value of Apples in Stock: 150

Test Case 2:
--------------- 
Sample Input:

Item Name: "Oranges"
Price per Unit: -5.0
Quantity in Stock: 20

Expected Output: 
Error message indicating invalid price.

Test Case 3: 
---------------
Sample Input :

Item Name: "Bananas"
Price per Unit: 5.0
Quantity in Stock: -10

Expected Output:
 Error message indicating invalid quantity.

Test Case 4 :
--------------- 
sample input :

Item Name: ""
Price per Unit: 8.0
Quantity in Stock: 10

Expected Output:
 Error message indicating invalid item name.


Question - 3
---------------
You are developing a task management application that allows users to create and manage their tasks efficiently. 

Design a Java class named Task (Business Class)

Attributes :

name			data type
-------			------------
title			: String
description		: String
priority		: String

Acess modifier : private(for all varriables)

Constructor: Initialize the task object all properties.


Methods:
[Return type of all methods is void and acess modifier is public]

updateDescription(String newDescription): This method should update the description of the task.

updatePriority(String newPriority): This method should update the priority level of the task.

markAsCompleted(): This method should mark the task as completed.

getTitle(): This method should return the title of the task.

getDescription(): This method should return the description of the task.

getPriority(): This method should return the priority level of the task.

isCompleted(): This method should return true if the task is completed, and false otherwise.


Create another class main which is having main method and instantiate the task object and execute the method.

Test Cases :

case -1
---------
Task Title: Finish Project
Task Description: Complete documentation
Task Priority: High
Is Task Completed? false

Expected Output: 
Valid input, (print all the above information)

case-2
---------
Title: ""
Description: "Complete documentation"
Priority: "High"

Expected Output: 
Error message indicating invalid title.

case-3
--------
Title: "Finish Project"
Description: ""
Priority: "High"

Expected Output: 
Error message indicating invalid description
