Write a program to find the area of the circle on the following criteria

Explanation:
Create a BLC(Business Logic Class) called Circle which contains a static method getArea()
Name of the Method 		:	getArea()
Parameter of the Method		:	one parameter of type double(radius)
Return type of the Method	:	String
Access modifier of the Method	:	public, static

Write the logic inside the method based on the following criteria
a) If parameter value is 0 or Negative it should return 0
b) If parameter value is positive it should print area of circle in two digits after decimal value example (12.89)

Create another class Test in the same package which is ELC class (contains main method) to test the application. Don’t create the Object in the Test class, call the static method getArea()
of Circle class  and print the output in the main method.

Note :- Both the classes must be declared with public access modifier

-----------
Write a program to print the Student data in the given format

Explanation:
Create a BLC(Business Logic Class) class Student which contains a static method getStudentDetails()

Name of the Method 		:	getStudentDetails()
Parameter of the Method		:	3 parameters roll ,name and fees of type int , String and double respectively.
Return type of the Method	:	String
Access modifier of the Method	:	public and static

Create another class Test in the same package which is ELC class (contains main method) to test the application. Don’t create the Object in the Test class, call the static method getStudentDetails() which should print the Student data in the following format
[ Roll is :101, Name is :Ravi, Fees is :14000.9]

Note :- Both the classes must be declared with public access modifier

----------
Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd

Explanation:
Create a BLC(Business Logic Class) class EvenOrOdd which contains a static method isEven()

Name of the Method 		: isEven()
Parameter of the Method		: one parameter of type integer
Return type of the Method	: boolean
Access modifier of the Method	: public

Write the logic inside the method isEven () to check number is even or odd

Create another class Test in the same package which is ELC class (contains main method) to test the application. Don’t create the Object in the Test class, call the static method isEven()
of EvenOrOdd class  to return number is even or odd and print the result in main method.

Note :- Both the classes must be declared with public access modifier

-----------
Write a program to check accept a number and check whether it is a 'Spy Number' or not. (A number is spy if the sum of its digits equals the product of its digits.)
Example: Sample Input: 1124
Sum of the digits = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8
Product of the digits = 1*1*2*4 = 8
Explanation:
Create a BLC(Business Logic Class) class called Calculate which contains a static method checkSpyNum ()

Name of the Method 		: checkSpyNum ()
Parameter of the Method		: one parameter of type integer
Return type of the Method	: void
Access modifier of the Method	: public

Create another class Test in the same package which is ELC class (contains main method) to test the application. Don’t create the Object in the Test class, call the static method checkSpyNum ()
of Calculate class.

Note :- Both the classes must be declared with public access modifier
