Program 01 :
------------
A BLC (Business Logic Class) called Student is given to you.
Instance Variables: 
studentId :private-int
studentName : private-String
marks: private-int
grade: private-char

method : calculateGrade():public:void

Create a method public void setStudentData() with the parameters: studentId, studentName, marks.

Note that grade is not set through method because it is a calculated value.

Methods :
displayDetails(): This method should return a String with  the details of the student in the following format:
Student [name=John Smith, studentId=123, marks=95, grade=A] 

calculateGrade(): This is a public method that calculates the grade based on the marks that is set. 
If marks is above 90, grade is set to A. 
If marks is between 81 and 90, grade is set to B, 
if marks is between 71 and 80, grade is set to C, 
if marks is between 61 and 70, grade is set to D, 
if marks is less than 61, grade is set to E.
Use this method when you need to set or reset grade.

An ELC(Executable Logic class) Tester with main method is given to you to test your code.

Program 02 :
------------
Create a BLC class Employee class with properties 

private String firstName
private String lastName
private int employeeId
private double salary
private int noOfProject


Create a setEmployeeData() method with 5 parameters to initialize all the instance variables.

Implement calculateSalary() method that will add extra ammount in salary based on NoOfProject by using following criteria.

NoOfProject is more than 5 and less that 10 then add 5000.
NoOfProject is more than 10 and less that 20 then add 10000.
NoOfProject is more than 20 then add 15000. 	

 Take a method called displayDetails() to display the salary.

 Take an ELC class Tester to test your logic.
